				<p class="typl8-drop-cap">&#8220;But surely it&#8217;s weird in the changing room? Don&#8217;t they think you&#8217;re looking? I mean, you are looking, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac jumps right in with the question everyone gets around to eventually, grinning and holding my gaze with an impish frankness that acknowledges the furtive, unrequited glances I used to steal at him in changing rooms before moving away.</p>
<p>I laugh to cover the blush that betrays me every time. &#8220;I try not to. It takes a lot of willpower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my God, no!&#8221; He explodes in amused outrage. &#8221; You&#8217;ve got to! Make the most of it! Our man on the inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>A neat, balding man sitting alone with his pint glances up at Isaac&#8217;s exclamations, the other inhabitant of the pub not taking part in a weekly quiz we spent about six months regularly embarrassing ourselves at; an indefatigable drag queen steamrollers on with a music video round, despite the only current participants being a giggling couple and a team of clueless bar staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they just know?&#8221; Isaac persists. &#8220;Or did you have to tell them?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>In truth I&#8217;d hoped that Facebook would do my dirty work for me, accepting the flurry of friend requests that came after the first couple of games I played. I&#8217;d scored in both, which was a relief as they were mostly younger and nippier than me, old teammates of my vintage having largely succumbed to family life, from what I heard. They still seemed genuinely surprised, though, when, worried that if left too long it would seem as though I&#8217;d been hiding it, I clunkily dropped an ex-boyfriend into conversation as we clattered away from the sports centre, the clench of anxiety inside my chest no less for having done this dozens of times before.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long into the next week&#8217;s game that I knew it was going to be okay. Sweeping me up in the celebration for a move I&#8217;d barely had any part in, Ali, a lanky youngster from Govan who&#8217;d been one of the chattiest since I joined, pulled me in with a long, sweaty arm and planted a kiss squarely on my forehead before sprinting back down the pitch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d made it pretty much every week since then, occasionally gathering to watch the match in a pub or a night out at the weekend too, although of course I clicked with some more than others: Lukasz loved to talk politics with me and we&#8217;d often have to be ushered out, still arguing, long past closing time, whilst Ali took to greeting me like a long-lost brother even if we&#8217;d seen each other the night before, over-powering my tentative, platonic pats with repeated, enveloping hugs. One or two were more cordial, smiling and chatting whilst a certain taut circumspection lingered beneath the surface, but in time even this seemed to dissipate.</p>
<p>There was some locker-room talk but it was pretty tame compared to the ribaldry I remembered from Rainbow FC, Isaac and the others giving their full and frank assessments of our opponents. Maybe they were inhibited by my presence but I didn&#8217;t get that impression, behind the odd joshing there was a quiet sense of conservatism about sex. Walking by ourselves one evening, Lukasz awkwardly expressed discomfort with some long-running banter about one lad&#8217;s fictitious infidelities to me. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to seem like a dick, you know?&#8221; He ventured, flicking me an anxious sideways glance.</p>
<hr />
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t not be thinking about it?&#8221; Isaac was warming to his theme. &#8220;Getting all hot and bothered together the whole time: look at how many of our teammates hooked up! You&#8217;re fixating on what you can&#8217;t have again. It sounds to me like this is one massive self-sabotaging displacement activity, designed to ensure you never get laid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get that on Grindr,&#8221; I deflect him, &#8220;But they never go for a pint with me afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Away from them, of course, it&#8217;s a subject my mind gnaws away at, the guilty flashes of half-formed lusts, the fear that these are breaking some undeclared rule, thought crimes that threaten to bring it all crashing down, but when I see them this evaporates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying it isn&#8217;t lurking there: that when Ali drapes a long arm around my shoulders in the club, pulling my ear so close to his mouth that I&#8217;m momentarily brushed by his fringe, desire doesn&#8217;t bubble up at the familiar onion tang of his sweat, but as he slurs excitedly about how much he wants the girl he&#8217;s started dating to meet me, it seeps away again, like the tightness between my shoulders, to leave something more precious.</p>			</div> <!-- /.columns -->
