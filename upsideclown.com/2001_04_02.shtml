<h1>
ET
</h1>

<p class="subhead">
<b>2 April 2001</b>
<br>
<a href="mailto:neil@upsideclown.com">Neil</a> needs to see a doctor.
</p>

<p class="major">
It had been loose in the box, a delicate metal sphere with the tell-tale 
glint of tiny lenses tracing a circumference. I knew which it was 
instinctively, the only imagiser not slotted neatly into the velvet-lined 
album my sister had bought me, and without thinking I balanced its 
indiscernible weight in my palm, the search for a working power cell 
suspended. I stared at the innocent-looking globe for a few moments then 
nochalantly flipped both switches with my thumb and took my hand away as the 
familiar snapshot of Paolo, looking over his shoulder with a half-smile of 
surprise, unfolded through three dimensions.
</p>
<p class="minor">
I reached into the centre of the image and began to turn the dial, expanding 
the projection, but then I's struck by the memory of when I'd first taken 
it, before I'd dared hope we'd become lovers, when I used to blow it up till 
he was almost life-size and I spun it back down to its default proportions. 
Five years was it now? Two since I'd so much as seen him. I reached out a 
trembling finger but it passed through his cheek and I felt nothing.
</p>

<p class="major">
I'd first been suggested ETs by my on-line therapist as a means of getting 
over the guilt when my father died but I'd not taken its suggestion and so 
it was with a certain trepidation that I let the stairs carry me up to Dr. 
Gulikson's offices. I couldn't avoid noticing a certain degree of 
embarrassment, also, at the obviousness of my destination, twitching every 
time I met the gaze of any other occupants of the cases criss-crossing the 
atrium, longing for an enclosed elevator, almost as if I was accessing a 
pleasure parlour. ETs were, after all, closely related to the technologies 
which provided release from sexual inhibitions, hastily removed from the 
market after their commercial availability was swiftly followed by a spate 
of deaths, but still widely obtainable from back-street neurologists.
</p>
<p class="minor">
The implacable chrome of Dr. Gulikson's door, etched with her name and a 
string of letters, her masters of science, her doctorate in neurological 
alteration, slid back and the sharp-featured vision of Dr. Gulikson herself 
rose to greet me.
</p>
<p class="minor">
"Good afternoon, Mr. Ridley." Her dark hair was tied tightly back in a 
pony-tail and she met my gaze through entirely cosmetic pince-nez. "Please 
have a seat. Now why is it you feel you need emotive technologies?"
</p>
<p class="minor">
I started to panic. What was it that had brought me here? How could I 
express it? The quiet despair of numbness, the gradual realisation that the 
memory of how his hands had felt on my body had faded without me noticing, 
that all the sex had blurred into one, my recollection of the whole 
relationship had been reduced to a handful of totemic incidents and the love 
that was supposed to last for ever had gone, like a wilful cat that slips 
quietly out into the night and nobody registers is missing for a week. I 
felt dirty and empty and Dr. Gulikson was waiting for her reply.
</p>

<p class="major">
"There's no need to be embarrassed, Mr. Ridley," she instructed as I flushed 
and stammered. "It's not at all unusual for a man of your" (she glanced at 
the screen in front of her) "<i>Intellect</i> to require our services. 
Forty-five per cent of our clients are Grade 2 workers."
</p>
<p class="minor">
"Sorry, I guess I'm just apprehensive about something that kinda amounts to 
chemically changing my personality."
</p>
<p class="minor">
"It's not about changing you, Mr. Ridley," she replied with a faint whiff of 
irritation, "Simply restoring a balance. You've allowed the passage of time 
to dim the intensity of the moment and your rational faculty to devalue what 
is no longer integral to your life. This is all about unblocking those 
channels."
</p>
<p class="minor">
"But didn't the STs make people do things they'd never have dreamed of, in 
normal circumstances?"
</p>
<p class="minor">
Dr. Gulikson's even tone was laced with severity. "I think you'll find that 
most people have a very plastic sexuality," the hint of a raised eyebrow, 
"Given the right conditions." I handed over my credit card.
</p>

<p class="major">
Back in the apartment I fingered the port at the nape of my neck: Paolo 
hadn't had one, a memorial to his upbringing in the Third Corporation where 
they still inoculated with hypodermics. Dr. Gulikson had warned me that an 
ET needed to be used at an appropriate juncture, shortly before driving had 
produced some particularly unconstructive results; I smiled at the irony 
that contemplating the means of administration had brought such an instance 
about and carefully inserted and discharged the shot.
</p>
<p class="minor">
Paolo used to trace the port in fascination. He'd come without a word whilst 
I's reading, lie beside me and trace round its subcutaneous rim, gently, 
with his finger, with his tongue. To begin with it was a kind of distant 
fear, stirring in the pit of my stomach: butterflies, mere anticipation, 
perhaps? Then the floodgate burst and, the sudden rush almost overwhelming 
me, I felt it all, like the day he walked out, the anguish and the yearning, 
no longer formulaic, easily distracted but sharp and real; my organs tore 
themselves apart, my mind floundered vainly to latch onto a single, coherent 
thought and in misery, pain and sheer sheer joy, I wept.
