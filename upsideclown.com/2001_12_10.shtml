<b>10 December 2001</b>
<br>
<a href="mailto:george@upsideclown.com">George</a> just made the Christmas post.
</p>

<p class="major">
Dear  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;reader&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.
</p>

<p class="major">
Well, Christmas has certainly come around quickly this year! It barely seems like yesterday that the Clown household were making their New Year resolutions, vowing to become better, more improved members of society in 2001! Whether the Clown family has achieved any of these goals is debatable, but we certainly have had interesting, even hectic year! George and Victoria in particular have been rushed off their feet, so apologies to those of you whom we haven't had a chance to get in contact with over the past 12 months!
</p>
<p class="minor">
So what have we all been up to?
</p>
<p class="minor">
The start of the year saw Victoria earning her hard-earned promotion, elevating her to Area Manager of the rubber duck manufacturers. Some of you may remember that this promotion has been a long time coming; Vics has been unfairly passed over for this position for some years. Despite the outcome of the industrial tribunal, it is clear that her managers have continued to treat her with undue suspicion.
</p>
<p class="minor">
The new job has naturally brought financial perks, and George and Victor took a long weekend away together to Gran Canaria over Easter. Not only giving us free time from the kids, this was also an opportunity for us to rekindle some of that old honeymooners romance. George's work has given him very little free time recently, what with recent EU legislations about child employment and the so-called "Human Rights" act. He and Vics had a splendid time (with more than a few thanks to Pfizer!) and returned much rested. 
</p>
<p class="minor">
Neil has been working hard at his A-levels (Maths, Business Studies and Economics), but is being distracted by a growing interest in "house" music. It's time for him to start thinking about university choices - Neil insists that he'll be going one of the further flung colleges, but George and Vics are hoping to persuade him towards a more local choice. George would be especially pleased if Neil were to attend his old <i>alma mater</i>, Portsmouth. Other events in 2001 for Neil include starting a weekend job at Burtons, and acting as a model for a high-street hair salon. The latter resulted in a particularly odd asymmetrical 'do (!) which was remedied by his local barber. 
</p>
<p class="minor">
Danielle left the family nest in June, to set up home with her latest beau, J (and no, we haven't found out what that stands for yet either!). They are still living locally, and George and Vics have had several interesting meals with them; J works as a chef in nearby Chichester, and has created many unusual dishes for us! He seems like a good, clean-living young man, and who know? Maybe Danielle will have her own special announcement about J and her next year! (no more "living in sin", eh!)! Danielle meanwhile continues her job with the council and is still taking salsa lessons.
</p>
<p class="minor">
We have heard little more from Jamie since last Christmas. The last e-mail sent indicates that he is somewhere in South America. Our solicitors inform us that there should be no reason for him not to return to Britain now, but possibly he is enjoying his new-found freedom. As George and Vics can testify, warm weather can be most soothing, so we hope than when Jamie eventually returns he will be in good spirits!
</p>
<p class="minor">
From the family house - we have redecorated the living room. Those of you who remember the lime and ginger scheme will be pleased to hear that it has been redone using damson, with gold trimming. We are unsure as to whether to continue and replace the furniture to fit in with this design. Our beagle Matthew remains in good health, and has recovered nicely from his little "operation" earlier in the year - no more puppies for him!
</p>
<p class="minor">
Well, that's pretty much it from <i>Chez Clown</i> this year! I hope that the festive seasons finds you in good spirits, and we hope to catch up with you in 2002!
</p>

Festive Greetings
